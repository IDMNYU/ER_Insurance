## IDM equipment room insurance requirement

In order to check things out from the IDM equipment room, you are required to carry insurance for at least $3,000. We need proof of this insurance before you can get the stuff you need to complete your assignments.

## HOW DO I GET INSURANCE?
Your family may have insurance that covers material goods, or you may have renters insurance already. If so, bring in a copy of the policy and we’ll check to make sure it’s all good. 

If your insurance doesn’t cover our equipment, or you don’t have it yet, College Student Insurance: http://www.collegestudentinsurance.com can cover you for $90/year. The benefit of this is not only can you check stuff out, but all your personal bellongings are covered too.

Things that CSI Covers:  Computers and laptops, Cell phones, iPhones and other smartphones, iPods, MP3 players and Electronics, Books, Clothes, Bicycles. 

What CSI protects against: Theft, Fire, Accidental Damage, Flood, Earthquake, Vandalism, Electrical Damage, Water Damage
